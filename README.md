# RuyLang
Ah, yes. I made another language.

Trying to implement [Let's Build a Simple Interpreter](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/) in C, probably won't be successful. If I actually make it work, it may replace QoLang.

To do:
- [ ] Implement statement list, compound statement, and assignment.
- [ ] Implement functions.
- [ ] Implement arguments for functions.
- [ ] Implement strings.
- [ ] Implement a small standard library.
- [ ] Implement boolean expressions and pointers.
- [ ] Implement comments.
- [ ] Implement if-else statements.
- [ ] Implement type function.
- [ ] Implement foreach, for, while, times loops.
- [ ] Implement exit function.
- [ ] Implement `&&` and `||` operators.
- [ ] Implement `!` operator.
- [ ] Implement formatted strings.
- [ ] Implement return statement.
- [ ] Implement lists.
- [ ] Implement NoneType.
- [ ] Implement add, sub, multiply and divide statements.
- [ ] Implement including and exporting system.
- [ ] Implement define statement.
- [ ] Implement `__main__` variable.
- [ ] Implement slicing and steps for lists.
- [ ] Implement local variables.
- [ ] Implement `in` operator.
- [ ] Implement floats.
- [ ] Implement a file library.
- [ ] Implement a date-time library.
